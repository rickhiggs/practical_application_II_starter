Assignment II for Emeritus MLAI Course
I was not very successful in producing a model to predict price from the dataset of cars provided.  The accompanying notebook holds my best result which is still not good.  I limited the data to pickups then further to a subset identified by Kmeans.  I am anxious to see how others in my group tackled the problem.  Given that the model if not very good, I will make no attempt to describe the cluster modeled.
