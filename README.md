Assignment II for Emeritus MLAI Course

2024.02.19 - I misread the instructions for this project.  I built a predictive model for pickups when the assignment only asked us to identify the importance of features.  If I can find time in the next few weeks, I'll revisit this exercise and provide what was requested.

I was not very successful in producing a model to predict price from the dataset of cars provided.  The accompanying notebook holds my best result which is still not good.  I limited the data to pickups then further to a subset identified by Kmeans.  I am anxious to see how others in my group tackled the problem.  Given that the model if not very good, I will make no attempt to describe the cluster modeled.
